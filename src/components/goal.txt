*. Group equivalent sections into one search result and allow selection
     - Dropdown menu to change to equiv sections

*. cap the number of results from the algorithm

*. GZIP the course data, and make github available demo version



*. Allow selection of search within different campus via a settings menu
     - 

*. If no yearly courses are selected, then separate fall/ winter result selectors can be used.

*. DnD to change to alternate section

*. Overall polish design:
    - change to <div> layout or ant grid
    - use absolute positioning
